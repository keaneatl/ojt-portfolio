After learning how to work with structured data sans-SQL, we tackled security fundamentals with SC-900T00--A: Microsoft Security, Compliance, and Identity Fundamentals. Today, I finished the following:

- **[Describe security and compliance concepts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/describe-security-concepts-methodologies/)**
  - I learned that the user has been working on a project and has been using a Work Log Calendar to track their progress. They have completed tasks related to understanding common security and compliance concepts that are foundational to Microsoft solutions. The tasks include understanding the shared responsibility and Zero Trust models, encryption, data residency and data sovereignty, and more.
- **[Describe identity concepts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/describe-identity-principles-concepts/)**
  - I learned how to use Azure compute solution for diverse scenarios. The module provided insights into various Azure compute services, including Azure Virtual Machines, Azure Batch, Azure App Service, Azure Container Instances, Azure Kubernetes Service, Azure Functions, and Azure Logic Apps. Additionally, I acquired the ability to assess and select the optimal compute service for my specific needs, applying design principles through practical case studies.
- **[Describe the function and identity types of Microsoft Entra ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/explore-basic-services-identity-types/)**
  - I learned the features and capabilities of Microsoft's cloud-based identity and access management solution, Entra ID. The module emphasized understanding the functions of Microsoft Entra ID, delineating the supported identity types, explaining hybrid identity, and elucidating external identities. I gained knowledge on establishing connections between individuals and their applications, devices, and data through Microsoft Entra ID. Furthermore, the module provided practical case studies to illustrate the application of design principles in this context
