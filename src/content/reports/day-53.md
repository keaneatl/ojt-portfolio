Today I continued working on AZ-1005---A: Configuring Azure Virtual Desktop for the Enterprise. I worked on the following modules:

- **[Manage access for Azure Virtual Desktop](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/manage-access/)**
  - I learned that Azure Architects work with external users in Microsoft Teams and manage access controls from different places, including Microsoft Entra ID, Microsoft 365, Teams, and SharePoint admin centers. The learning objectives include understanding external access, guest access, and managing external collaboration.
- **[Manage security for Azure Virtual Desktop](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/manage-security/)**
  - I learned that Azure Architects design and recommend cloud security solutions. The framework emphasizes Zero Trust principles, best practices, and real-world experiences to guide organizations in modernizing their security practices and tooling during cloud adoption. Key takeaways include understanding cloud security methodology, identifying security roles and responsibilities, assessing cultural and role changes, and simplifying compliance and security implementation in the cloud.
