We were tasked to take a course entitled “Introduction to Artificial Intelligence” and complete it to
earn a certification. The course tackled topics such as symbolic systems, Artificial Intelligence (AI),
Machine Learning (ML), Natural Language Processing (NLP), ML Algorithms, Neural Networks, and
much more.
I was able to complete the course by going through the lectures and taking the NASBA CPE exam
and scoring 100%.
