Today I continued working on AZ-305T00--A: Designing Microsoft Azure Infrastructure Solutions. I worked on the following modules:

- **[Design migrations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/design-migrations/)**
  - I learned that Azure Architects design and recommend migration solutions. The module covers various aspects, including evaluating migration with the Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure, describing the Azure Migration and Modernization Program (Azure Migration Framework), assessing on-premises workloads, selecting migration tools, migrating databases, and handling online storage and offline data migration.
- **[Introduction to the Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/azure-well-architected-introduction/)**
  - I learned that Azure Architects design and recommend logging and monitoring solutions. The framework emphasizes six pillars: cost optimization, operational excellence, performance efficiency, reliability, and security. By adhering to these principles, architects can create a solid foundation for their cloud architecture and continuously improve it.
- **[Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework - Cost Optimization](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/azure-well-architected-cost-optimization/)**
  - I learned that Azure Architects design and recommend cost optimization strategies. The five principles of the Cost Optimization pillar include:
  Develop cost-management discipline: Create a financial tracking system, segment expenses, and predict cost changes.
        Design with a cost-efficiency mindset: Prioritize optimization strategies aligned with business requirements.

        Design for usage optimization: Maximize resource utilization without sacrificing requirements.

        Design for rate optimization: Make the most of services and offerings to avoid underutilization.

        Monitor and optimize over time: Continuously adjust costs as workloads evolve.
