Today I continued working on SC-900T00--A: Microsoft Security, Compliance, and Identity Fundamentals. Today, I finished the following:

- **[Describe Microsoftâ€™s Service Trust portal and privacy capabilities](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/describe-compliance-management-capabilities-microsoft/)**
  - I learned that the user has been working on a project and has been using a Work Log Calendar to track their progress. They have completed tasks related to understanding the compliance management capabilities in Microsoft. The tasks include exploring the Microsoft Purview compliance portal, learning about the Compliance Manager and compliance score, which can help organizations manage, simplify, and improve compliance across their organization.
- **[Describe the compliance management capabilities in Microsoft Purview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/describe-compliance-management-capabilities-microsoft-365/)**
