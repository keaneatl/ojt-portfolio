Today I finished working on DP-3015---A: Getting Started with Cosmos DB NoSQL Development. I worked on the following modules:

- **[Implement a non-relational data model](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/implement-non-relational-data-model/)**
  - I learned that the user has been working on a project and has been using a Work Log Calendar to track their progress. They have completed tasks related to implementing a non-relational data model. The tasks include identifying an application’s key access patterns, defining the entities’ data model, along with containers to store the data with a partition key that will result in an efficient and scalable data store for the application.
- **[Design a data partitioning strategy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/design-data-partitioning-strategy/)**
  - I learned that the user has been working on a project and has been using a Work Log Calendar to track their progress. They have completed tasks related to designing a data partitioning strategy. The tasks include managing relationships between data entities by using advanced modeling and partitioning strategies, maintaining the referential integrity of your data by using change feed, implementing pre-aggregating and denormalizing data strategies to improve data-model performance and scaling, and optimizing storage and compute by mixing entity types in a single container.
