Today I continued working on AZ-305T00--A: Designing Microsoft Azure Infrastructure Solutions. I worked on the following modules:

- **[Getting started with the Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/cloud-adoption-framework-getting-started/)**
  - I learned that Azure Architects design and recommend logging and monitoring solutions. The framework provides guidance throughout the cloud adoption lifecycle, addressing common roadblocks and offering shared approaches from thousands of customers. Key objectives include understanding roadblocks, evaluating relevant guides, and using shared guidance to unblock cloud adoption efforts.
- **[Prepare for successful cloud adoption with a well-defined strategy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/cloud-adoption-framework-strategy/)**
  - I learned that Azure Architects align business, people, and technology strategies to achieve business goals. The framework provides actionable, efficient, and comprehensive guidance for fast results with control and stability. Key components include unlocking business triggers, tracking the cloud journey, defining strategy, and anticipating expected outcomes.
