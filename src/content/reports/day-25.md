Next on the Microsoft Roadmap was: DP-3015---A: Getting Started with Cosmos DB NoSQL Development. I worked on the following modules:

- **[Introduction to Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/introduction-to-azure-cosmos-db-sql-api/)**
  - I learned about Azure Cosmos DB and its SQL API, including how to try it out, plan resource requirements, and configure it for NoSQL databases and containers.
- **[Try Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/try-azure-cosmos-db-sql-api/)**
  - I learned that the user has been working on a project and has been using a Work Log Calendar to track their progress. They have completed tasks related to planning resource requirements and configuring Azure Cosmos DB for a NoSQL database and containers. Additionally, they have mentioned Day 5 of Week 9 as a milestone.
- **[Plan Resource Requirements](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/plan-resource-requirements/)**
  - learned that the user has been working on a project and has been using a Work Log Calendar to track their progress. They have completed tasks related to planning resource requirements and configuring Azure Cosmos DB for a NoSQL database and containers. The tasks include understanding throughput, evaluating throughput requirements, evaluating data storage requirements, and planning for data retention with Time-to-live (TTL).
