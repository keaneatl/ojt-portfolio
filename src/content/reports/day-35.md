  - From the “Describe Information Protection and Governance Capabilities in Microsoft 365” module, I learned that the user has been working on a project and has been using a Work Log Calendar to track their progress. They have completed tasks related to understanding the information protection and governance capabilities in Microsoft 365. The tasks include describing data classification capabilities, records management, data loss prevention, and unified data governance.
