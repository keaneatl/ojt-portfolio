Today I continued working on DP-3015---A: Getting Started with Cosmos DB NoSQL Development. I worked on the following modules:

- **[Configure Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL database and containers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/configure-azure-cosmos-db-sql-api/)**
  - I learned that the user has been working on a project and has been using a Work Log Calendar to track their progress. They have completed tasks related to configuring Azure Cosmos DB for a NoSQL database and containers. The tasks include comparing the various service and throughput offerings for Azure Cosmos DB, migrating between standard and autoscale throughput, and configuring throughput for Azure Cosmos DB SQL API with the Azure portal.
