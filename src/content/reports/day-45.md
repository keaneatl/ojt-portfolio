Today I continued and finished working on AZ-305T00--A: Designing Microsoft Azure Infrastructure Solutions. I worked on the following modules:

- **[Migrate to Azure through repeatable processes and common tools](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/cloud-adoption-framework-migrate/)**
  - From the “Migrate methodology” module in the Cloud Adoption Framework, I learned that Azure Architects design and recommend migration solutions. The iterative process involves assessing, migrating, optimizing, and promoting workloads to meet production demands. Whether using a rehost (lift-and-shift) approach for immediate sustainability and cost savings, or a replatform (modernize) approach for better efficiency and innovation, the goal is to ensure successful cloud adoption.
- **[Address tangible risks with the Govern methodology of the Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/cloud-adoption-framework-govern/)**
  - I learned that Azure Architects design and recommend cloud governance solutions. The framework emphasizes iterative processes, corporate policy integration, and an initial governance foundation called a minimum viable product (MVP).
- **[Ensure stable operations and optimization across all supported workloads deployed to the cloud](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/cloud-adoption-framework-manage/)**
  - I learned that Azure Architects design and recommend cloud management solutions. This guidance serves two purposes:
    It provides examples of actionable operations management approaches based on common customer experiences.
    It helps create personalized management solutions aligned with specific business commitments.
