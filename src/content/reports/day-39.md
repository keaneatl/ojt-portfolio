Today I continued working on AZ-305T00--A: Designing Microsoft Azure Infrastructure Solutions. I worked on the following modules:

- **[Design authentication and authorization solutions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/design-authentication-authorization-solutions/)**
  - I learned that Azure Architects design and recommend authentication and authorization solutions. The module covers various aspects, including designing for identity and access management, Microsoft Entra ID, business-to-business (B2B) scenarios, Azure Active Directory B2C, conditional access, identity protection, access reviews, managed identities, service principals for applications, and Azure Key Vault.
- **[Design a solution to log and monitor Azure resources](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/design-solution-to-log-monitor-azure-resources/)**
