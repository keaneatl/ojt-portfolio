Today I continued working on AZ-1005---A: Configuring Azure Virtual Desktop for the Enterprise. I worked on the following modules:

- **[Implement and manage storage for Azure Virtual Desktop](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/implement-manage-storage-azure-virtual-desktop/)**
  - I learned that Azure Architects design and recommend storage solutions for Azure Virtual Desktop. Key takeaways include:
  Choosing appropriate storage for FSLogix components.
  Configuring storage for FSLogix components.
  Configuring storage accounts for Azure Files.
  Adding a new managed data disk to a Windows virtual machine for Azure Virtual Desktop.
  Creating file shares for storage accounts in Azure Virtual Desktop.
- **[Create and configure host pools and session hosts for Azure Virtual Desktop](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/create-configure-host-pools-session-hosts/)**
  - I learned that Azure Architects design and recommend cloud solutions for virtual desktops. The module covers configuring host pool assignment types, automating Azure Virtual Desktop host pool creation using PowerShell, customizing Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) properties, and managing licensing for Windows client session hosts.
- **[Create and manage session host image for Azure Virtual Desktop](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/create-manage-session-host-image/)**
  - I learned that Azure Architects design and recommend cloud solutions for virtual desktops. The module covers creating a managed VM image for an Azure Virtual Desktop-specific configuration, modifying session host images, planning for image updates and management, using a Shared Image Gallery (SIG) for Azure Virtual Desktop, installing language packs, and more.
