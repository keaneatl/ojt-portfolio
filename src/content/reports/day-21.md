Today I continued working on AI-102T00--A: Designing and Implementing a Microsoft Azure AI Solution course. I worked on the following modules:

- **[Create an Azure AI Search solution](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/create-azure-cognitive-search-solution/)**
  - I learned how to create and configure an Azure Cognitive Search solution. This module covered topics such as creating an Azure Cognitive Search service, defining an index schema, uploading data to the index, and querying the search index. It provided practical guidance on how to implement and utilize Azure Cognitive Search to build powerful search capabilities for applications.
- **[Create a custom skill for Azure AI Search](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/create-enrichment-pipeline-azure-cognitive-search/)**
  - I learned how to enhance the search capabilities of Azure Cognitive Search by creating custom skills. These skills allow for the extraction of structured information from unstructured data, such as text documents. By creating an enrichment pipeline, I can incorporate custom skills, such as entity recognition and key phrase extraction, to extract valuable insights from the documents and improve the search experience for users.
- **[Create a knowledge store with Azure AI Search](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/create-knowledge-store-azure-cognitive-search/)**
  - I learned how to create and configure a knowledge store using Azure Cognitive Search. A knowledge store allows for the ingestion, enrichment, and organization of structured and unstructured data, enabling powerful search and analysis capabilities. The module covered topics such as creating and configuring an Azure Cognitive Search service, defining an index schema, and using cognitive skills to extract valuable insights from documents. Overall, it provided practical guidance on how to leverage Azure AI Search to create a knowledge store for efficient data management and retrieval.
