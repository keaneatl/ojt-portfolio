Today I continued working on AI-102T00--A: Designing and Implementing a Microsoft Azure AI Solution course. I worked on the following modules:

- **[Classify images](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/classify-images/)**
  - I learned how to use Azure Cognitive Services to classify images. This module provided an overview of image classification techniques and covered topics such as creating and training custom image classification models using Azure Custom Vision, evaluating model performance, and deploying and consuming the trained models. It also discussed best practices for improving the accuracy of image classification models and integrating them into applications.
- **[Detect, analyze, and recognize faces](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/detect-analyze-recognize-faces/)**
  - I learned how to use Azure Cognitive Services to detect and analyze faces in images. This includes techniques such as face detection, face verification, and face identification. The module also covered topics such as detecting emotions and facial attributes, as well as best practices for working with face recognition algorithms. Overall, it provided a comprehensive overview of the capabilities and applications of face detection and analysis using Azure AI services.
- **[Read Text in images and documents with the Azure AI Vision Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/read-text-images-documents-with-computer-vision-service/)**
  - I learned how to use the Azure AI Vision Service to extract text from images and documents. This module covered topics such as optical character recognition (OCR), text extraction from images, and document analysis. It provided insights into the capabilities and applications of the Azure AI Vision Service for reading text in various scenarios.
