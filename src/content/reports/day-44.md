Today I continued working on AZ-305T00--A: Designing Microsoft Azure Infrastructure Solutions. I worked on the following modules:

- **[Prepare for cloud adoption with a data-driven plan](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/cloud-adoption-framework-plan/)**
  - I learned that Azure Architects design and recommend cloud adoption plans. These iterative project plans help companies transition from traditional IT approaches to modern, agile approaches. The cloud adoption plan aligns technical efforts with the organization’s business strategy, addressing aspects such as skills readiness, digital estate inventory, and organizational alignment.
- **[Choose the best Azure landing zone to support your requirements for cloud operations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/cloud-adoption-framework-ready/)**
