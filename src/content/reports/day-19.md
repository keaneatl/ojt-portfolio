Today I continued working on AI-102T00--A: Designing and Implementing a Microsoft Azure AI Solution course. I worked on the following modules:

- **[Build a conversational language understanding model](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/build-language-understanding-model/)**
  - I learned how to build a conversational language understanding model using Azure AI services. This module covered topics such as creating intents, entities, and utterances, training and publishing a language understanding model, and integrating the model into a conversational application. It provided practical examples and guidance on how to design and implement a conversational language understanding solution using Azure AI services.
- **[Create a custom text classification solution](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/custom-text-classification/)**
  - I learned how to create a custom text classification model using Azure AI services. This module covered topics such as preparing training data, training and evaluating the model, and deploying and consuming the trained model. It provided practical examples and guidance on how to build a custom text classification solution to classify text documents into predefined categories.
- **[Create a custom named entity extraction solution](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/custom-name-entity-extraction/)**
  - I learned how to create a custom named entity extraction solution using Azure AI services. This module covered topics such as preparing training data, training and evaluating the model, and deploying and consuming the trained model. It provided practical examples and guidance on how to build a custom named entity extraction solution to identify and extract specific entities from text documents
