Today I continued working on AI-102T00--A: Designing and Implementing a Microsoft Azure AI Solution course. I worked on the following modules:

- **[Get started with Azure OpenAI Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/get-started-openai/)**
  - I learned about getting started with Azure OpenAI Service. This module provides an introduction to the Azure OpenAI Service and covers topics such as creating an OpenAI workspace, deploying models, and using the OpenAI Python SDK. It also discusses use cases and best practices for leveraging Azure OpenAI Service for building AI-powered applications.
- **[Apply prompt engineering with Azure OpenAI Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/apply-prompt-engineering-azure-openai/)**
  - I learned how to leverage Azure OpenAI Service to generate text using prompts. Prompt engineering involves formulating effective prompts to generate desired outputs from the model. It covers techniques such as specifying the desired format, providing context, and using system messages to guide the model's behavior. By utilizing prompt engineering, developers can enhance the quality and relevance of the generated text from the Azure OpenAI Service.
