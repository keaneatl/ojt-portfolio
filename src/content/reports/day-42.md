Today I continued working on AZ-305T00--A: Designing Microsoft Azure Infrastructure Solutions. I worked on the following modules:

- **[Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework - Operational excellence](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/azure-well-architected-operational-excellence/)**
  - I learned that Azure Architects design and recommend operational excellence solutions. The module emphasizes modern practices for designing, building, and orchestrating resources on Azure. Key takeaways include applying monitoring and analytics for operational insights, reducing effort through automation, and improving application quality with tests.
- **[Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework - Performance efficiency](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/azure-well-architected-performance-efficiency/)**
  - I learned that Azure Architects design and recommend performance optimization strategies. The module emphasizes scaling capacity based on workload, optimizing network performance, enhancing storage and database performance, and identifying application bottlenecks.
- **[Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework - Reliability](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/azure-well-architected-reliability/)**
  - I learned that Azure Architects design and recommend reliability solutions. The module emphasizes five principles:
  Determine reliability requirements from business needs.
  Design fault-tolerant workloads that can degrade gracefully.
  Plan for recovery from component-level faults to disasters.
  Build observability and testing into workload design.
  Prioritize simplicity to minimize risks.
- **[Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework - Security](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/azure-well-architected-security/)**
  - I learned that Azure Architects design and recommend security solutions. The module emphasizes five principles:
  Create a security readiness plan aligned with business priorities.
  Handle confidentiality requirements effectively.
  Strengthen workload integrity against security risks.
  Enhance workload availability in the face of security incidents.
  Continuously maintain and improve security posture
