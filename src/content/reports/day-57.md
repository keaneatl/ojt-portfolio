For the last day we had to present a summary of our internship with TechOne Global Ltd., the things we learned, the most challenging part of the program, and what our biggest takeways were.

This day concluded our internship with TechOne Global, which proved to be fruitful as we delved into concepts we touch on in our academics, but fully explore professionally. Overall, it was a great learning experience.
