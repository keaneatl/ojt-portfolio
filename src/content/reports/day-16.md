Today I continued working on AI-102T00--A: Designing and Implementing a Microsoft Azure AI Solution course. I worked on the following modules:

- **[Monitor Azure AI services](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/monitor-ai-services/)**
  - I learned about the importance of monitoring Azure AI services. This includes monitoring the health and performance of AI models, tracking usage and consumption of resources, and identifying and resolving issues or anomalies. Monitoring helps ensure the reliability, availability, and optimal functioning of AI services, allowing for timely adjustments and improvements as needed.
- **[Deploy Azure AI services in containers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/investigate-container-for-use-with-ai-services/)**
  - I learned about how containers can be used to deploy AI services. Containers provide a lightweight and portable way to package and run applications, including AI models. They offer benefits such as improved scalability, easier deployment, and consistent runtime environments. By using containers, developers can streamline the deployment process and ensure consistent performance across different environments.
- **[Analyze images](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/analyze-images/)** - I learned how to use Azure Cognitive Services to analyze images. This includes extracting visual features like objects, colors, and brands from images, as well as detecting and recognizing faces. The module also covered techniques for analyzing image content, such as identifying landmarks and celebrities. Overall, it provided a comprehensive overview of image analysis capabilities using Azure AI services.
