Today I continued and finished working on AI-900T00--A: Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals. Today I worked on the following modules:

- **[Fundamentals of Computer Vision](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/analyze-images-computer-vision/)**
  - I learned that the Azure AI Vision Image Analysis service can extract a wide variety of visual features from images. It can determine whether an image contains adult content, find specific brands or objects, and identify human faces. The latest version, 4.0, includes features like synchronous OCR and people detection.
- **[Fundamentals of Facial Recognition](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/detect-analyze-faces/)**
  - I learned that face detection, analysis, and recognition are crucial capabilities for artificial intelligence (AI) solutions. The Azure AI Face service simplifies integrating these capabilities into applications. The module covers options for face detection, considerations for face analysis, and how to detect faces using the Azure AI Vision service. Additionally, it explores the capabilities of the Face service and compares and matches detected faces.
- **[Fundamentals of optical character recognition](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/read-text-computer-vision/)**
  - I learned that optical character recognition (OCR) enables artificial intelligence (AI) systems to read text in images, allowing applications to extract information from photographs, scanned documents, and other digitized sources. The Azure AI Vision service provides tools for reading text in images, making it easier to incorporate OCR capabilities into applications.
- **[Fundamentals of Azure AI Document Intelligence](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/analyze-receipts-form-recognizer/)**
  - I learned that Azure AI Document Intelligence provides prebuilt receipt processing capabilities, allowing organizations to automate data extraction from various document types, including receipts and invoices. This module covers how to use these capabilities effectively.
- **[Fundamentals of Knowledge Mining and Azure AI Search](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/intro-to-azure-search/)**
  - I learned that Azure AI Search enables developers to create powerful search solutions. It involves defining enrichment pipelines using skillsets, building indexes with an indexer, and persisting enriched data in a knowledge store. The module covers creating and querying indexes for better search results.
- **[Fundamentals of Generative AI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/fundamentals-generative-ai/)**
  - I learned that generative AI leverages large language models (LLMs) to create original content based on natural language input. These models enable AI applications and services to generate creative responses. Additionally, generative AI plays a role in creating AI-powered copilots that assist humans in various tasks.
- **[Fundamentals of Azure OpenAI Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/explore-azure-openai/)**
  - I learned that Azure OpenAI enables building solutions against OpenAI artificial intelligence models within Azure. It covers generative AI models, language, code, and image capabilities, as well as responsible AI practices and limited access policies.
- **[Fundamentals of Responsible Generative AI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/responsible-generative-ai/)**
  - I learned that generative AI leverages large language models (LLMs) to create original content based on natural language input. These models enable AI applications and services to generate creative responses. Additionally, generative AI plays a role in creating AI-powered copilots that assist humans in various tasks.
