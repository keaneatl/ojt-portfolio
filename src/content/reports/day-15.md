  - I learned about the preparation required to develop AI solutions on Azure. This module covers topics such as understanding AI solution development, exploring AI development tools and technologies, and understanding AI solution requirements and considerations. It provides an overview of the different Azure services and tools available for developing AI solutions, including Azure Machine Learning, Cognitive Services, and Azure Databricks. Additionally, it discusses the importance of data preparation and management, as well as the ethical and responsible use of AI technologies.
- **[Create and consume Azure AI services](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/create-manage-ai-services/)**
  - I learned how to create and manage Azure AI services. This module covered topics such as creating and deploying AI models using Azure Machine Learning, integrating AI services into applications using REST APIs, and managing AI service instances and endpoints for scalability and performance.
- **[Secure Azure AI services](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/secure-ai-services/)**
  - I learned about the importance of securing Azure AI services. This module covered topics such as implementing secure authentication and authorization mechanisms, protecting data privacy and confidentiality, and applying security best practices for AI service deployment. It also discussed techniques for monitoring and auditing AI services to ensure their security and compliance with regulatory requirements.
