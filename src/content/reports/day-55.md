Having knowledge in AI in general, we wanted to know how to work with AI on the cloud with Azure, so we took AI-900T00--A: Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals. Today I worked on the following modules:

- **[Fundamental AI Concepts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/get-started-ai-fundamentals/)**
  - I learned that AI can enable remarkable advancements in various fields, from healthcare to environmental protection. The module covers common AI workloads, Azure AI services, and responsible AI practices.
- **[Fundamentals of machine learning](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/fundamentals-machine-learning/)**
  - This module emphasizes the importance of understanding overfitting, regularization techniques, and the Bias-Variance Tradeoff in machine learning.
- **[Fundamentals of Azure AI services](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/fundamentals-azure-ai-services/)**
  - I learned that Azure AI services provide essential tools for building applications. These services can be accessed through the Azure portal, and their keys and endpoints are used for authentication. Additionally, the module covers creating and utilizing an Azure AI services resource in a Content Safety Studio setting
