After the weekly recurring meeting,
for the purpose of upskilling and in preparation for the tasks ahead, I was tasked to attend the Microsoft Security Virtual Training Program which was divided into two parts. Throughout the training program we had an inside look into Microsoft Security best practices that focused not only on businesses and organizations but other stakeholders as well in order to further secure interactions with Microsoft products and services.

However, problems did arise as the platform hosting the training program was buggy and unstable.
