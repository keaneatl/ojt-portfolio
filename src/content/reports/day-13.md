Today I continued working on the MS-900T01—A: Microsoft 365 Fundamentals course. I worked on the following modules:

- **[Describe endpoint modernization, management concepts, and deployment options in Microsoft 365](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/describe-endpoint-modernization-management-concepts-deployment-options/)**

  - This module discusses how business management solutions through Microsoft 365 provide people with a secure personalized desktop experience. I was able to get a grasp of the endpoint modern management capabilities of Microsoft 365, the difference between Microsoft 365 and Azure VD, and the deployment methods and update channels for Microsoft 365 Apps

- **[Describe analytics capabilities of Microsoft 365](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/describe-analytics-capabilities-microsoft-365/)**

  - This module provided me an overview of how the analytics capabilities through Microsoft 365 can help build better work habits and improve the employee experience with data-driven insights and reports.

  To be more specific, the module expounded on Viva Insights and its capabilities, Microsoft 365 admin center and user portal and its capabilities, and the reports available in Microsoft 365 admin center.

  - This module provided me an overview of Microsoft Entra ID, Microsoft’s cloud-based identity and access management solution.

  This module talked about Microsoft Entra ID, its functions and its supported identities such as hybrid and external.

- **[Describe access management capabilities of Microsoft Entra ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/explore-access-management-capabilities/)**

  - This module was brief and provided me the information to be able to describe the Conditional Access in Entra ID, as well as the Microsoft Entra roles and RBAC.

- **[Describe threat protection with Microsoft Defender XDR](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/describe-threat-protection-with-microsoft-365-defender/)**
  - What I learned from this module was what Microsoft Defender XDR was and that it protects across endpoints, identities, email, and applications and also how to use the Microsoft Defender Portal.
  It also defines its additional service type of as a cloud based email filtering service.
