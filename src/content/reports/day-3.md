For my third day of research, I focused on documenting all the details and differences between the
Microsoft 365 Bussiness Basic, Microsoft 365 Business Standard, Microsoft 365 Business Premium,
and the Microsoft 365 Apps for business plans. I was able to highlight which desktop, web, mobile
apps, and secure cloud services were available for which plan.
