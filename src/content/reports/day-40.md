Today I continued working on AZ-305T00--A: Designing Microsoft Azure Infrastructure Solutions. I worked on the following modules:

- **[Design network solutions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/design-network-solutions/)**
  - I learned that Azure Architects design and recommend network solutions. The module covers various aspects, including recommending a network architecture solution based on workload requirements, designing for on-premises connectivity to Azure Virtual Network, Azure network connectivity services, application delivery services, and application protection services.
- **[Design a solution for backup and disaster recovery](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/design-solution-for-backup-disaster-recovery/)**
  - From the “Design a solution for backup and disaster recovery” module, I learned that Azure Architects design and recommend backup solutions and disaster recovery solutions for Azure workloads. The module covers various aspects, including designing for backup and recovery, Azure Backup, Azure blob backup and recovery, Azure Files backup and recovery, Azure virtual machine backup and recovery, Azure SQL backup and recovery, and Azure Site Recovery.
