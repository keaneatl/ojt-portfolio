Today I continued working on DP-3015---A: Getting Started with Cosmos DB NoSQL Development. I worked on the following modules:

- **[Implement Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL point operations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/implement-azure-cosmos-db-sql-api-point-operations/)**
  - I learned that the user has been working on a project and has been using a Work Log Calendar to track their progress. They have completed tasks related to implementing Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL point operations. The tasks include performing CRUD operations using the SDK, configuring TTL for a specific item, creating documents, reading a document, updating documents, and deleting documents.
- **[Query the Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/query-azure-cosmos-db-sql-api/)**
  - I learned that the user has been working on a project and has been using a Work Log Calendar to track their progress. They have completed tasks related to querying Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL. The tasks include understanding the difference between point reads and queries in Azure Cosmos DB, understanding SQL query language, creating queries with SQL, projecting query results, and querying arrays.
- **[Author complex queries with the Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/author-complex-queries-azure-cosmos-db-sql-api/)**
  - I learned that the user has been working on a project and has been using a Work Log Calendar to track their progress. They have completed tasks related to authoring complex queries with Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL. The tasks include implementing a correlated subquery, creating a cross-product query, and adding variables in queries.
