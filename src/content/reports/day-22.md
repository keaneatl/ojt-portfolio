Today I continued working on AI-102T00--A: Designing and Implementing a Microsoft Azure AI Solution course. I worked on the following modules:

- **[Plan an Azure AI Document Intelligence solution](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/plan-form-recognizer-solution/)**
  - I learned about planning an Azure AI Document Intelligence solution. This module provided insights on how to utilize Azure Form Recognizer to extract structured data from unstructured documents such as forms. It covered topics such as understanding the capabilities of Azure Form Recognizer, planning the implementation of the solution, and considering factors like data labeling, model training, and deployment options. Overall, it offered practical guidance on leveraging Azure AI services for document processing and data extraction.
- **[Use prebuilt Azure AI Document Intelligence models](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/use-prebuilt-form-recognizer-models/)**
  - I learned how to leverage the prebuilt models in Azure Form Recognizer to extract structured data from various types of documents such as invoices, receipts, and business cards. These prebuilt models provide a convenient and efficient way to automate data extraction tasks without the need for extensive training or custom model development. By utilizing the prebuilt models, organizations can streamline their document processing workflows and improve data accuracy and efficiency.
- **[Extract data from forms with Azure Document Intelligence](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/work-form-recognizer/)**
  - I learned how to use Azure Form Recognizer to extract structured data from various types of forms. This includes techniques for training and fine-tuning models, as well as using the Form Recognizer API to process forms and extract data fields. The module provided practical examples and guidance on how to leverage Azure Document Intelligence for automating form data extraction processes.
