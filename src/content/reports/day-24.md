Today I continued working on and finished AI-102T00--A: Designing and Implementing a Microsoft Azure AI Solution course. I worked on the following modules:

- **[Use your own data with Azure OpenAI Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/use-own-data-azure-openai/)**
  - I learned about using custom data with Azure OpenAI Service. This module covers topics such as preparing and formatting custom datasets for training, fine-tuning language models using custom data, and deploying and using the trained models for generating text. It provides practical examples and guidance on how to leverage Azure OpenAI Service with custom data to generate more tailored and specific outputs.
- **[Fundamentals of Responsible Generative AI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/responsible-generative-ai/)**
  - I learned that the author has been studying and working on various topics related to Microsoft Azure AI solutions. They have covered areas such as compliance management capabilities, Microsoft 365 pricing and licensing options, support offerings for Microsoft 365 services, and designing and implementing Azure AI solutions. They have also delved into specific modules on image analysis, text analysis, speech-enabled applications, and document intelligence. Additionally, they have mentioned their progress in the AI-102T00--A: Designing and Implementing a Microsoft Azure AI Solution course. Unfortunately, the link to the module on responsible generative AI is missing from the provided text.
