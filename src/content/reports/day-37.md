Today I continued working on AZ-305T00--A: Designing Microsoft Azure Infrastructure Solutions. I worked on the following modules:

- **[Design a data storage solution for non-relational data](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/design-data-storage-solution-for-non-relational-data/)**
  - From the “Design a Data Storage Solution for Non-Relational Data” module, I learned that the user has been working on a project and has been using a Work Log Calendar to track their progress. They have completed tasks related to designing a data storage solution for non-relational data. The tasks include designing for data storage, Azure storage accounts, Azure blob storage, data redundancy, Azure files, an Azure disk solution, and storage security.
- **[Design a data storage solution for relational data](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/design-data-storage-solution-for-relational-data/)**
  - I learned that the user has been working on a project and has been using a Work Log Calendar to track their progress. They have completed tasks related to designing a data storage solution for relational data. The tasks include designing for Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Managed Instance, SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines, recommending a solution for database scalability and availability, designing protection for data at rest, data in transmission, and data in use
